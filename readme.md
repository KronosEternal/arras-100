# Features

- Moaning!
- Cock and ball torture!
- Server speeds so laggy that it looks like your playing on a power point!
- More white colors on the screen that looks lime cum!
- No!
- More themes!
- Fixed hotkeys! (Be sure your server project has them binded)
- Deployment to Repl.it or Heroku! Still works with Glitch!
- Webserver compatibility with 6 different languages!
- In-game Chat!

The client is able to be hosted as either a Node.js Express, PHP, Go HTTP, Ruby Webrick, C or Python Flask webserver.
Additonal code is available on my Github project's page, <https://github.com/seaguli/arras-mayhem>

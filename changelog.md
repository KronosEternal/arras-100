# Its add more chaos carter

- Added chat to testing server!

# Hola

- Hey its Carter here
- Ethan wanted me to add stuff to the changelogs, either to benefit people or make their life more chaotic. We may never know
- But anyways im gonna be messing around with the changelogs from time-to-time, so look forward to  that
- ok bye

# Large Update! Read Below

# Balancing Starting Soon!

# ANNOUNCMENTS:

- Steven will manage "feedback" aka complaints because he is head of HR, not me
- Carter, Steven and Me (somewhat) will be balancing things (I will mostly be coding new tanks, them balancing since they can't do much else rn)
- Johnathan is an official server stress tester and his only job is to inflict pain in the name of science
- The chat function DOES NOT WORK yet in the teaching server due to glitch things
- Help menu for commands has been  fixed to be more user friendly

# SERVER STATUS THING:

- will be used and implemented to show you which servers are dead, being fixed, or im to clueless to realize (helps this idiot *looking in mirror* fix things as well)
- if I don't screw it up, it should also show the problem, whether by incompetent devs *stares in mirror again* or heroku being an ass (or github) so yeah, but it also
assumes that I can code it in the first place :/

# GENERAL CHANGES:

- commands now can be accessed through the "/help" without murdering the server
- TEACHING SERVER: server will be custom designed, has been added as the "Glitch Unknown Thing" Server, not fully ready yet, but works.
- simple UI changes (gradient on top 3 buttons), (less crazy styles), stability fixes, reliability increased (of client, not servers yet)
- added server locations so they don't all just say "worldwide" which they aren't
- All server locations are based on ping
- some are slightly laggier than others, but all remain under 220 ms delay (220 milliseconds for those who can't read)
- Background changed again
- commands now can be accessed through the "/help" without murdering the server

# Hello New Players!

- proof that Ethan made this game, with help from Johnathan, Steven, Carter, and members of the glitch community :)
